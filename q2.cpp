/* 
Solution to Q2 of the ant problem. An analytical solution alongside a computational implementation is given in this file.


Question:

An ant leaves its anthill in order to forage for food. 
It moves with the speed of 10cm per second, but it doesnâ€™t know where to go. 
Every second it moves randomly 10cm directly north, south, east or west with equal probability.

What is the average time the ant will reach food 
if it is located only on a diagonal line passing through (10cm, 0cm) and (0cm, 10cm) points?


Analytic solution:

Consider a 5 x 5 grid with each point being discretely mapped, with the origin marked by *, food points by o, 
																					cardinal points by c, and diagonal points by d

Unlike q1, it is no longer possible to calculate a finite set of possible move combinations that could occur, as the ant
is effectively unbound. Below are a set of rules the the ant must follow, before finding food:

1. Starting from the origin, it is possible to move one tile to immediately get food [*, o]

2. The ant wanders around, and finds itself on a [d] point nearest to [*] and 1 move away from [o] - [..., d, o]

3. The ant wanders around, and comes back to the origin eventually, which then leads to food [..., *, o]

4. The ant wanders around, and goes to a [c] point 1 move away from the origin [..., c, d, o] OR [..., c, *, o]

The problem is, an infinite amount of these can be listed, as the coordinate space is no longer closed into a box as per Q1.
Therefore, it is possible to generate an infinite number of these possibilities, and thus to get the expectation value given by:
E = \sum (p * x), one would have sum an infinite series of numbers which therefore means n (expected number of seconds):

n = inf

// Computational solution:
// If this file is ran with 1000000 iterations, the iterations never complete, meaning that it is an infinite result.
// If a capacity to number of steps is applied (artificial barrier for the ant at a prohibitively large x and y), the
// mean and S.D scale according to this number, further reinforcing the answer.

#include <random>
